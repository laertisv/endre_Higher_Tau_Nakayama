We are working with linear Nakayama algebras with homogeneous relations, admitting a \(d\)-cluster tilting subcategory \(\mathcal{C}\).
Specifically, for an algebraically closed field \(\mathbf{k}\), we are working with the algebras \(\Lambda(n,l)=\mathbf{k}\mathbb{A}_n/R^l\), where \(R\) is the arrow ideal of the quiver \(\mathbb{A}_n\) given by
$$ n\longrightarrow n-1 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow 2 \longrightarrow 1 .$$
The indecomposable modules of \(\operatorname{mod}\Lambda\) are uniquely given through their support on \(\mathbb{A}_n\), which can be described as subintervals of \([1,n]\).
Hence, they will be denoted by \(M(a,b)\), where \([a,b]\) is their support-interval.

<p>
For some more preliminary information on the \(d\)-cluster tilting subcategory of \(\Lambda(n,l)\) and the possibility of constructing your own \(\tau_d\)-rigid pair, visit <a href="./construct.html">here.</a>
Note that a <em>summand-maximal \(\tau_d\)-rigid pair</em> \((M,P)\) is a \(\tau_d\)-rigid pair of \(\mathcal{C}\) such that for any other \(\tau_d\)-rigid pair \((N,Q)\) we have \(|N|+|Q|\leq |M|+|P|\).
We have shown that for \(\Lambda(n,l)\) a \(\tau_d\)-rigid pair \((M,P)\) is summand-maximal if and only if \(|M|+|P|=n\).

<h2>Mutation <span style="color:gray;cursor: pointer;" onclick="toggleSection(this,'textMutation1')">&#9207</span></h2>

The paper [RV24] only deals with the concept of mutation on a surface level, however as it bears witness of the over-arching structure we provide some of our findings here.
</p>
<figure class="definition">
<p>
Let \((M,P)\) and \((M',P')\in \mathcal{C}\times \operatorname{proj}\Lambda\) be summand-maximal \(\tau_d\)-rigid pairs of \(\Lambda(n,l)\).
If there exists a pair \((N,Q)\in\mathcal{C}\times\operatorname{proj}\Lambda\) that is a summand of both \((M,P)\) and \((M',P')\), and \(|N|+|Q|=n-1\), then \((M,P)\) and \((M',P')\) are <em>mutations of each other</em>.
</p>
</figure>
<p>
The first observation we want to share is that the \(\tau_d\)-mutation graph of summand-maximal \(\tau_d\)-rigid pairs (<em>sm-\(\tau_d\)-mutation graph</em> for short) over \(\Lambda(n,l)\) is connected [RV, Proposition 6.10].
This is not true in general, see the following example:
